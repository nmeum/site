* cache is a little bit of a hack, it only caches individual parts not the entire compilation step
	* therefore, the files are always recreated nonetheless
	* it would be could if we could explore allowing custom `resourceModified` functions in hakyll
	* maybe we could enhance the identifier product type with a field for that
* don't rebuild on `git status` with `watch`

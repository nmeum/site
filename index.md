Hi! 👋 I am [nmeum][mastodon], a computer programmer from Germany.
I am passionate about functional programming (mostly #Scheme# and #Haskell#), software security, and operating systems.
Further, I occasionally contribute to open-source software such as [Alpine Linux][Alpine GitLab] or [Guix][Guix Commits].
I also run a Git server where I host my own [hobby projects][git.8pit.net] (mirrored on [GitHub]).
By day, I work as a computer science researcher, head to my [work homepage] for more information on that.

This site presents [selected notes][evergreen notes] from my [zk notebook][zk].
They are loosely categorized using tag keywords and often cross-reference each other.
The site is generated using [Hakyll], more information is [available separately](notes/c0p9).
The majority of notes concern themselves with all matters related to computing.
This includes programs I have written, software I use, and configuration files for that software.

Hi! 👋 I am [nmeum][mastodon], a computer programmer residing in Germany.
I am passionate about functional programming (mostly #Scheme# and #Haskell#), software security, and operating systems.
Further, I occasionally contribute to free and open source software projects such as [Alpine Linux][Alpine GitLab] or [Guix][Guix Commits].
I also run a Git server where I host my own [hobby projects][git.8pit.net] (mirrored on [GitHub]).
By day, I work as a computer science researcher, head to my [work homepage] for more information on that.

This site contains notes from my [zk notebook][zk github].
The notes are loosely categorized using tag keywords and often cross-reference each other.
They may (or may not) be continuously updated.
With regard to their topic, the majority of notes concern themselves with all matters related to computing.
This includes—among other things—programs I have written, software I use, and configuration files for that software.

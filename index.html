	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>Hi! 👋 I am <a rel="me" href="https://chaos.social/@nmeum">nmeum</a>, a computer programmer residing in Germany.
	I am passionate about functional programming (mostly Scheme and Haskell), software security, and operating systems.
	Further, I occasionally contribute to free and open source software projects such as <a rel="me" href="https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/nmeum">Alpine Linux</a> or <a href="https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/commits/branch/master/search?q=author%3A%40soeren-tempel.net&all=">Guix</a>.
	I also run a Git server where I host my own <a rel="me" href="https://git.8pit.net">hobby projects</a>.
	By day, I work as a computer science researcher, head to my <a rel="me" href="https://soeren-tempel.net/">work homepage</a> for more information on that.

	<p>This site contains notes from my <a href="https://github.com/zk-org/zk">zk notebook</a>.
	The notes are loosely categorized using tag keywords and often cross-reference each other in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#Use_in_personal_knowledge_management">zettelkasten-like fashion</a>.
	With regard to their topic, the majority of notes concern themselves with all matters related to computing.
	This includes—among other things—programs I have written, software I use, and configuration files for that software.

	<p>The website is generated using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, a static site generator written in the <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language.
	More information about the setup is available in <a title="All pages tagged 'Hakyll'." href="tags/hakyll.html">separates notes</a>.
	The site’s structure is inspired by the <a href="http://werc.cat-v.org">werc anti-framework</a>, the stylesheet draws inspiration from <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock">Haddock</a>.

<h1>About</h1>

On this site, I present selected notes from my <a href="https://github.com/zk-org/zk">zk notebook</a>.
The notes are loosely categorized using tag keywords and often cross-reference each other in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten#Use_in_personal_knowledge_management">zettelkasten-like fashion</a>.
With regard to their topic, the majority of notes concern themselves with all matters related to computing.
This includes—among other things—programs I have written, software I use, and configuration files for that software.
The website is generated using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a>, a static site generator written in the <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> programming language.
More information about the setup is available in <a href="notes/726w.html">a seperate note</a>.
